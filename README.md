# UIL Enhanced Archives

A searchable archive of past UIL competition results

## Features

  - Archives:
    - Takes the benefits of the old archive system being all on one page and combines it with the recency of speechwire.
    - Able to export as a csv file to import into spreadsheets.

  - Virtual Contest:
    - Able to combine multiple archives into one mega contest.
    - Able to add your own scores to add yourself to the past contest.
    - Use Case: See how you stack up against all the districts in your region or all the regions in your state
    - Use Case: See how one school in 4A stacks up against all the schools in 5A
    - Use Case: See how you would have done at a meet many years ago.

  - Search for a Competitor or School:
    - See all instances of a competitor or a school in past years.

  - Live Results:
    - See what results for what events have been submitted for a particular year.
    - Green if results are posted. Red if they aren't

  - Academic Alignments:
    - Type in a school/year and see what district and region they're in as well as the other schools in their district

## To Do
  - Implement a Web Scraper to get past contest results from existing archives with Python (?)
  - Implement filters and sorters for each section with JavaScript or React (?)
  - Add CSS for each page
